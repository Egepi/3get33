Single Plaer vs. Computer

Number of levels = 2 + user built levels

#------------------------------------------
Rules:

PickUps:
	"1-ups" = add +1 life to total lives
>>>>	"S" = add + 25 to shiled up 100
>>>>	"A" = add + 25 to armor up to 100
Bombs:
	Small bombs = 25pts of damage
	Large bombs = 60pts of damage
Guns:
	Basic Type = 5pts per shot  - 1 bullet per tick
	Double Shot = 8pts per shot - 2 bullets per tick
	Amazing shot = 15pts per shot - 3 bullets per tick
Ship:
	Max armor is 100points
	Max shield is 100points
	Shield is ALWAYS reduced from damage taken before armor

Regular baddie:
	Max armor - set depending on level
		i.e. 25pts lvl 1
		     40pts lvl 2
	NO shield
	Movement straight down from top of screen then
		stop at pre-determined point
	Rate of fire = 0.25x
		when to start firing is random so not
		all baddies shoot at once

Questions/Issues:

Can the user save the game mid level?
Can the user pause the game?
If the user presses quit during play, pop up warning screen?
	If warning screen, is the game paused till yes or no is pressed?
What kind of stats will be kept track of?
	Score, # of enimes killed, Accuracy, Damage taken, Damage delt
If the user beats a user or prebuilt level and play again is clicked,
	is the prebuilt level1 or user level automaticall reloaded or
	is the user brought back to the GameTypeSelect screen?
